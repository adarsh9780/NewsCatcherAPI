# NewsCatcherAPI
Gather news using NewsCatcher Api and Python

The goal of this project is to gather News using NewsCatherAPI (https://www.newscatcherapi.com/) and use train a BERT model to summarize and analyse the sentiment of the article. Hopefully, we'll be able to convert this project to a free website using Streamlit.
